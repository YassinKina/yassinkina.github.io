## About 
I am a Computer Scientist and researcher-in-training currently pursuing a Master’s in Computational Linguistics at the University of Tübingen, following a B.S. in Computer Science from Tufts University.

My work sits at the intersection of Computer Vision and Multimodal Learning. While my current studies provide a deep dive into the nuances of NLP, my primary ambition is to bridge the gap between vision and language to solve complex real-world problems. I am particularly driven by the challenges of medical computer imaging, where I aim to develop reproducible, experiment-driven systems that have a tangible impact on human health.
