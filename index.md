title: "Hello, I'm Yassin 👋"
---

I am a **Master's Student in Computational Linguistics** at the **University of Tübingen**, spanning the gap between linguistic theory and applied Natural Language Processing (NLP).

My work focuses on building robust, efficient models that solve real-world problems. I am particularly interested in **transfer learning**, **fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and optimizing NLP pipelines for consumer hardware (Apple Silicon).

### 🚀 Recent Work

**[📦 Amazon Sentiment Insight Engine](/projects/)**
I recently fine-tuned a **RoBERTa** model to move beyond binary sentiment analysis. By training on 12,000+ reviews, I achieved **72% accuracy** in detecting granular 1-5 star ratings, overcoming massive class imbalance issues in the standard dataset.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch (MPS), Hugging Face, Streamlit.

### 🔭 What I'm Working On Now
I am currently exploring **Medical Entity Recognition**, developing systems to extract structured clinical data from unstructured text.

### 📫 Get in Touch
I am always open to discussing NLP research, collaboration, or new opportunities.
