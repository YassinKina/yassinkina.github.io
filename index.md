## 🔭 Research Focus: Computational Modeling of Classical Arabic
My current research focuses on the intersection of Machine Translation (MT) and Historical Linguistics. Specifically, I am exploring methods to bridge the gap between Classical Arabic (the language of the Quran and classical literature) and modern target languages.

The Challenge: Addressing the severe data scarcity (low-resource) of Classical Arabic and the syntactic/semantic shifts between CA and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).

Methodology: Investigating Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning and Zero-Shot Translation techniques using Transformer-based models. I am particularly interested in how Quranic Tajweed rules and classical morphology can be used as structured constraints to improve translation accuracy.

Goal: To develop translation pipelines that preserve the rhetorical nuance of classical texts while maintaining modern fluency.
