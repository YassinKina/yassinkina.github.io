## Let's Connect
I am currently seeking Werkstudent or HiWi opportunities in Tübingen or the broader Cyber Valley ecosystem.
 
I’m particularly interested in roles involving NLP, Computer Vision, and Multimodal Modeling.

If you’re working on applied AI, I would love to connect and discuss how I can contribute.
